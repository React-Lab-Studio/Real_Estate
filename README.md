## Problem Statement
The traditional real estate market often suffers from inefficiencies, such as a lack of centralized information, difficulty in finding suitable apartments, and complicated booking processes. Users struggle to find verified listings, view apartments remotely, and manage bookings in a seamless manner. Additionally, real estate agents and property owners face challenges in reaching potential clients effectively. Our Real Estate App aims to address these issues by providing a user-friendly platform where users can search for apartments, view photos and details, and make bookings effortlessly.

## Motivation
The real estate industry is rapidly evolving, and digital solutions are becoming increasingly
necessary for enhancing user experience. The motivation behind this project is to:
1. Simplify the property search process by providing a centralized platform.
2. Ensure transparency and trust by displaying verified apartment details and photos.
3. Enhance convenience by allowing users to book apartments online without physical visits.
4. Expand market reach for property owners and real estate agents.
5. Future-proof the app with integrations like Google Maps for location-based searches.

## Features
1. User Authentication: Secure login and signup.
2. Profile Management: Users can edit and update personal details.
3. Property Search: Advanced search options with filters.
4. Apartment Details: High-quality photos, descriptions, and pricing.
5. Booking System: Users can reserve apartments through the app.
6. Google Maps Integration (Future Plan): View property locations on an interactive map.

## Development Environment
The Real Estate App will be built using:
1. Frontend: React Native (for cross-platform compatibility on iOS and Android)
2. Backend & Database: Firebase (for authentication, data storage, and real-time updates)
3. State Management: Context API / Redux (for global app state management)
4. UI Framework: Tailwind CSS / NativeWind (for styling and responsiveness)
5. Testing: Jest, React Native Testing Library (for unit and integration testing)
6. Version Control: Git & GitHub (for tracking changes and collaboration)
7. Development Tools: Expo (for streamlined development and testing), Android Studio.

## Development Approach:
We are using the <b> Agile Development Model </b>, which ensures:
1. Iterative Development: Features are built and tested in sprints.
2. Continuous Feedback: Regular user input helps improve functionality.
3. Scalability & Flexibility: Easily adaptable to changing requirements.
4. Faster Deployment: Enables quicker Minimum Viable Product (MVP) release.
